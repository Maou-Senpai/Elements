These are roughly the size of a drawing pin and are used for pacemakers, guided missiles and radios. The radioactive decay of it is used to make a phosphor give off light and this light is converted into electricity by a solar cell. It can also be used as a source of x-rays and radioactivity in measuring instruments.";
