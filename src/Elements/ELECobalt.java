        this.description = "Although it is used in electroplating to give objects an attractive surface that resists oxidation, it is more widely used to form alloys. Alnico, an alloy consisting of aluminum, nickel and this is used to make powerful permanent magnets. Stellite alloys, which contain this, chromium and tungsten, are used to make high-speed and high temperature cutting tools and dyes. It is also used to make alloys for jet engines and gas turbines, magnetic steels and some types of stainless steels.";
