        this.description = " About 90 percent of it goes into steel alloys. Steel containing this element is stronger, tougher, and more rust-resistant. Such alloys are in space vehicles and aircraft. A common use of its alloys is in tools used for cutting and grinding. A lot of its alloy with steel goes to building and heavy construction uses; less goes to transportation, machinery, and tool applications.";
