        this.description = "As with most isotopes, it is radioactive, meaning the nucleus is unstable and will break down, releasing energy in the process. This energy can often be used for nuclear power energy. One downfall of it is being a radioactive element is that it makes it toxic toward organisms, damaging cells when exposed.";
