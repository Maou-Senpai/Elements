        this.description = "A corrosion resistant metal that is used in high performance pumps and valves. Since it also does not easily absorb neutrons, it is widely used in nuclear reactors. The nuclear power industry uses nearly 90% produced each year, which must be nearly free of hafnium. It is also used as an alloying agent in steel, to make some types of surgical equipment and as a getter, a material that combines with and removes trace gases from vacuum tubes.";
