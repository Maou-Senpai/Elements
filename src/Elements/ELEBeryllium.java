        this.description = "A silvery-white metal. It is relatively soft and has a low density. Used in alloys with copper or nickel to make gyroscopes, springs, electrical contacts, spot-welding electrodes and non-sparking tools. Mixing this element with these metals increases their electrical and thermal conductivity.";
